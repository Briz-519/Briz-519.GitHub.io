<p>A. would come B. will come</p>
<p>C. came D. have come</p>
<p><code>would rather(宁愿)后跟从句时，从句用虚拟语气，谓语动词用过去式形式，表示与现在事实相反,错综虚拟语气注意tomorrow</code></p>
<p>There are two major problems linked with atomic power plants, the first （）concerns nuclear waste.</p>
<p>A. of which B. of the two</p>
<p>C. of them D. of the plants</p>
<p><code>A前后两句逗号相连，都出现谓语动词，因此我们可以断定两句一定是主从句形式，后半句为非限定性定语从句，用介词+which引导</code></p>
<p>The factory produced many famous cars, none of     shipped to foreign countries.</p>
<p>A. them        B. which           C. it               D. what</p>
<p><code>本题容易误选 B。容易被认为是一个非限制性定语从句。理由是 none 后面 没有并列连词 and, but。但是，ship 在这里是一个及物动词，意思为“运送……到”，也就 是说这里的 shipped 是一个过去分词，后面的部分是一个独立主格结构。如果在 shipped 前 面加一个 was，则应该选 B，构成非限制性定语从句</code></p>
<p>The manager decided to give the job to     he believed had a strong sense of duty.</p>
<p>A. whoever          B. whomever     C. who             D. those</p>
<p><code>作宾语从句的主语；he believed 可视为插入语</code></p>
<p>​         to speak when the audience interrupted him. A. Hardly had he begun            B. No sooner had he begun</p>
<p>C. Not until he began             D. Scarcely did he begin</p>
<p><code>hardly...when...是固定句型。no sooner...than...与它是同义词，都是一...就...的意思。且如果否定词在句首，要用倒装</code></p>
